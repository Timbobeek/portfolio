# Welcome to my portfolio website!

This is a repository for my first and only so far web page which is my portfolio. I have applied all of my knowledge so far of Frontend and UI/UX to build this creature. 

### This is Edition 2.0

In the first edition, I did not have Hobbies and Projects pages done and the entire page looked very raw, especially on mobile devices. In the current version, I tried to make it look neat on all screen sizes and to fill out all pages with useful information while maintaining cleanliness of my code. I am not 100% satisfied with it, it is will a WIP in my mind. 

### Ideas for this site 

-Consider using a library for the UI/UX to make it look more fresh<br/>
-Make sound effects on pushing resume download button?<br/>
-Translate into another language (russian)<br/>
-Have a different color mode<br/>
-Have some statistics counter (amount of visits, from where, etc)<br/>

### Next things to do

-Edition 2.0 is complete so far!
